# issue-tracker

This project is an issue tracking application that can be used to communicate what needs to be done on a particular, or group of projects. Things like bugs, new features, technical updates, bumping version are all tasks that can be represented as tickets. With these tickets you can create a new "workspace" for each including a chat where progress and blockers can be documented and discussed. These tickets can also be assigned to particular developers who have been added as "members" of the particular project, this way everyone is able to see what each other is working on.
