# issue-tracker

This project is an issue tracking application that can be used to communicate what needs to be done on a particular, or group of projects. Things like bugs, new features, technical updates, bumping versions are all tasks that can be represented as tickets. With these tickets you can create a new "workspace" for each including a chat where progress and blockers can be documented and discussed. These tickets can also be assigned to particular developers who have been added as "members" of the particular project, this way everyone is able to see what each other is working on.

Tickets can be divided into 4 main groups

To Do: This is the backlog, everything that needs to be done resides here. When tickets are created they default to this category. From here anyone can go in and claim tickets and start working on them as they please.

In Progress: This section is for tickets which have been claimed and work has began. At this point a ticket can not be just claimed by anyone as someone has already claimed it and started working on it. In order to update the ticket holder a request must be sent to the current holder, similar to a friend request. When transfer is approved, then the ticket will reflect the new owner.
